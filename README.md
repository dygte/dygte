# ***Introduction***

Welcome to my silly little profile!

My username's dygte and i'm currently learning C# from Unity and also kinda doing some things with HaxeFlixel.  
*cough*.. friday night funkin. *cough*..  

HaxeFlixel is a really interesting game engine to me cause apparently there doesn't seem
to be any user interface to build the game and you have to eye-ball everything when coding.  
It's something really weird to me but I think it's a fun little challenge
(and i also think that whoever works with this program on a daily basis is a straight god).

I program little things since I was a kid but it still feels like i'm just starting to dip
my toes into a huge ocean of possibilities. Maybe someday i'll take this thing as a job...

I also have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzqXu10stskzvFuXjGgQww)
where I plan to post future videos. :)
